The metagit project can be used to manage a huge amount of git
repositories at one. For example clone all your github Repositories to
a folder on your new shinny machine.

The configuration is located in the main python skript `metagit'. Edit
it so make it fit your needs. For more information on commands try
`pydoc gmp' to the python module documentation.
